A Java int[5] array is stored in the heap memory.

It uses 20 bytes for the 5 integers (5 × 4 bytes).

If the base address is 100, the array occupies 100 to 119.

120 is the first byte after the array and acts as the outer boundary.

Element byte ranges:
index 0 → 100–103
index 1 → 104–107
index 2 → 108–111
index 3 → 112–115
index 4 → 116–119

Indexing uses the starting byte of each element (100, 104, 108, 112, 116) for both getting and setting values.

No need to think about bits at all.
